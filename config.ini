description="Sandbert has a phone, oh gosh oh frick. This is a template that allows YOUR CHARACTER to access Tips, Frame Data, Cheat Codes, Patch Notes, and more through the MunoPhone! ...As long as you play on the Training Town companion stage. The code is very simple and user-friendly, so you too can give your character powerful bonus features! Also, if you use this as the foundation for a NEW character (in place of the regular Sandbert), you can enjoy several changes that will streamline the creation process and set you on the right track for character balance. There's also a CSS display for alt costumes, version number, and character compatibility. Check out the Muno's Works collection for socials, Discord, Patreon, and (most importantly) more cool mods - including the required Training Town stage."
